# Clojure for WebAssembly

Resources and experiments to explore the feasibility of WebAssembly as
a full Clojure target/platform.

## Rationale

With the recent finalization of Garbage Collection (WasmGC) and
related standards, WebAssembly has the potential to become a true
universal runtime (avoiding many of the pitfalls of earlier attempts
at this goal). Other major GC languages seem like they either have or
will soon have a backend targeting WebAssembly. Now seems like the
right time to bring full WebAssembly support to Clojure. We should
start exploring this now and also give feedback to the standards work
to make sure that Wasm works well for languages like Clojure.
